The criteria that make a planet habitable include:

1. **Location in the Habitable Zone:** A planet must be located in the "habitable zone" around its star, where temperatures allow for liquid water to exist on its surface.

2. **Atmospheric Conditions:** A suitable atmosphere is essential for protecting life from harmful radiation and maintaining the right pressure for liquid water.

3. **Geological Activity:** Active geology can help recycle nutrients and maintain a stable climate, which is beneficial for sustaining life.

4. **Potential for Unexpected Environments:** Recent discoveries suggest that life can exist in extreme conditions, indicating that the criteria for habitability may be broader than previously thought. This is particularly relevant in systems like [[Potential for Additional Planets in the HD 23472 System | source text]] and may also relate to the [[Formation Mechanisms of Super-Mercuries]]. Additionally, these considerations are linked to the findings in [[11 Com b Overview]] and may also apply to [[14 Herculis b Exoplanet Overview | source text]]. Furthermore, the characteristics of [[16 Cyg B b Exoplanet Overview]] may provide additional insights into habitability.

5. **Interactions with Other Celestial Bodies:** The presence of other planets and their interactions can also influence a planet's habitability.

These factors are part of a complex network of interactions that determine whether a planet can support life. For more details, see [[Criteria for Planet Habitability]].

### Follow-Up Questions:
1. What are some examples of exoplanets that are considered potentially habitable?
2. How do scientists determine the atmospheric composition of distant planets?
3. What role does water play in the search for extraterrestrial life?
