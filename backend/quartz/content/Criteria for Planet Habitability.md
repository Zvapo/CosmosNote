Here are the key factors that make a planet habitable:

1. **Location in the Habitable Zone**: A planet must be located in the "habitable zone" around its star, where temperatures are just right for liquid water to exist on its surface. This zone varies depending on the star's size and temperature.

2. **Presence of Water**: Liquid water is essential for life as we know it. A planet must have the right conditions to maintain water in its liquid state.

3. **Atmospheric Conditions**: A suitable atmosphere is crucial for protecting life from harmful radiation and maintaining stable temperatures. The atmosphere should also contain essential gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide.

4. **Potential for Unexpected Environments:** Recent discoveries suggest that life can exist in extreme conditions, indicating that the criteria for habitability may be broader than previously thought. This is particularly relevant in systems like [[Potential for Additional Planets in the HD 23472 System | source text]] and may also relate to the [[Formation Mechanisms of Super-Mercuries]]. Additionally, these considerations are linked to the findings in [[11 Com b Overview]] and may also apply to [[14 Herculis b Exoplanet Overview | source text]]. Furthermore, the characteristics of [[16 Cyg B b Exoplanet Overview]] may provide additional insights into habitability.

5. **Stable Climate**: A stable climate over geological timescales is important for the development and sustainability of life.

6. **Magnetic Field**: A magnetic field can protect a planet's atmosphere from being stripped away by solar winds, which is vital for maintaining conditions suitable for life.

These criteria are based on our understanding of life on Earth, but researchers are continually discovering new environments that may support life, which could expand the definition of habitability [[Criteria for Planet Habitability]]. Additionally, the size of a planet plays a significant role in its habitability, particularly in relation to its radius [[Largest Habitable Planets]].

### Follow-Up Questions:
1. What are some examples of exoplanets that are considered potentially habitable?
2. How do scientists determine the habitable zone for different types of stars?
3. What role does the presence of an atmosphere play in the potential for life on a planet?
