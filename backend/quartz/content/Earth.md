Earth is the third planet in our [[Solar system | solar system]]. It is the only planet known to have life, which is assessed based on various [[Criteria for Planet Habitability]]. The size and characteristics of Earth contribute to its habitability, particularly its radius in relation to the [[Largest Habitable Planet Radius | source text]] and [[Largest Habitable Planets]]. Additionally, recent findings in [[Recent Research on Habitable Planets]] provide further insights into the conditions that support life, including those discussed in [[Understanding Habitable Planets]]. For information on the current conditions on Earth, refer to [[Current Weather in Poznan]].
