**Note: Factors That Make a Planet Habitable**

1. **Liquid Water**: The presence of liquid water is essential for life as we know it. It serves as a solvent for biochemical reactions and is crucial for the survival of organisms.

2. **Stellar Habitable Zone**: A planet must be located within the "habitable zone" of its star, where temperatures allow for liquid water to exist. This zone varies depending on the star's size and temperature.

3. **Atmosphere**: A suitable atmosphere is necessary to protect life from harmful radiation, maintain temperature, and provide essential gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide.

4. **Mass and Size**: The planet must have sufficient mass to retain an atmosphere and maintain geological activity, which can support a stable climate and recycling of nutrients.

5. **Geological Activity**: Active geology can help regulate a planet's climate and create diverse environments, which are important for sustaining life.

6. **Magnetic Field**: A magnetic field can protect a planet's atmosphere from being stripped away by solar winds, which is crucial for maintaining conditions suitable for life.

7. **Stable Environment**: A stable climate over geological timescales is important for the development and sustainability of life.

**Direct Answer**: A planet is considered habitable if it has liquid water, is located in the habitable zone of its star, possesses a suitable atmosphere, has the right mass and size to retain that atmosphere, exhibits geological activity, has a protective magnetic field, and maintains a stable environment over time.
