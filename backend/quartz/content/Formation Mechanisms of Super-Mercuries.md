The formation of super-Mercuries, which are rocky exoplanets with a high density and significant iron content, can be attributed to several mechanisms:

1. **Inward Migration through the Protoplanetary Disk**: One of the primary theories suggests that super-Mercuries may form through the inward movement of planetary bodies within the protoplanetary disk. This process allows planets to migrate closer to their host stars, where they can experience different environmental conditions that influence their composition and density.

2. **Recondensation of Iron Vapor**: Another proposed mechanism involves the recondensation of outward-drifting iron vapor near the iron evaporation front. This process can lead to an increase in the iron content of the planet, contributing to its high density.

3. **Magnetic Erosion**: Magnetic erosion, as discussed in studies by Hubbard (2014) and Kruss & Wurm (2018), suggests that the magnetic field of a star can strip away lighter elements from a planet's atmosphere, leaving behind a denser, iron-rich core.

4. **Population Synthesis Models**: These models indicate that the formation of super-Mercuries may be favored in systems where planets are either water-poor or water-rich, suggesting that the environmental conditions during formation play a crucial role in determining the final composition of the planets.

5. **Resonant Systems**: The formation of resonant systems, where planets interact gravitationally, may also contribute to the development of super-Mercuries, particularly in systems with multiple planets.

These mechanisms highlight the complex interplay of factors that can lead to the formation of super-Mercuries in a given planetary system.

### Follow-Up Questions:
1. What are the characteristics that distinguish super-Mercuries from other types of exoplanets?
2. How do the environmental conditions around a star influence the formation of rocky planets?
3. Are there any known super-Mercuries in our galaxy, and what have we learned from their study?
