The largest known habitable planet is LHS 3154b, which has been identified as potentially habitable due to its location within the habitable zone of its star. However, it is important to note that its large mass suggests it may have a composition similar to that of Neptune, which raises questions about its actual habitability.

### Research Highlights:
- **LHS 3154b**: This exoplanet is notable for its size and position within the habitable zone, which is the region around a star where conditions might be right for liquid water to exist. For more information, see [[Largest Habitable Planets]].
- **Composition**: Given its mass, LHS 3154b likely has a composition akin to Neptune, which may affect its ability to support life as we know it. For more details, see [[Understanding Exoplanets | its actual habitability]].

### Follow-Up Questions:
1. What criteria are used to determine if a planet is habitable?
2. Are there any other large exoplanets that are considered potentially habitable?
3. How do scientists study the atmospheres of [[Exoplanets]] to assess their habitability?
