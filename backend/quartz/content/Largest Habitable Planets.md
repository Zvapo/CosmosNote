**Note on the Largest Habitable Planets:**

1. **Largest Habitable Planets:**
   - The largest potentially habitable exoplanets are often categorized as "super-Earths," which are larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants. See [[Understanding Habitable Planets]] for more details.
   - Some notable candidates include:
     - **Kepler-22b**: Approximately 2.4 times the radius of Earth, located in the habitable zone of its star.
     - **Kepler-186f**: About 1.1 times the radius of Earth, also in the habitable zone.
     - **LHS 1140 b**: Roughly 1.4 times the radius of Earth, located in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star.

2. **TRAPPIST-1 System:**
   - While not the largest, the TRAPPIST-1 system is significant for having seven Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, making it a prime target for the search for extraterrestrial life. See [[Understanding Habitable Planets | TRAPPIST-1 system]] for more information.

3. **Smallest Known Exoplanet:**
   - The search for habitable planets also includes the study of smaller exoplanets. For more information, see [[Smallest Known Exoplanet]].
