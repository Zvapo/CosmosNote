### Summary of Findings on the HD 23472 System:

1. **Current Understanding:**
   - The HD 23472 system, also known as TOI-174, is confirmed to have at least five exoplanets orbiting the K-dwarf star. This indicates a more complex system than previously recognized.
   - The known exoplanets include HD 23472 d, which is a terrestrial planet with a mass of 0.55 Earths, orbiting its star every 4 days at a distance of about 0.04298 AU.

2. **Possibility of Additional Planets:**
   - Given the nature of planetary formation and the dynamics of multi-planet systems, it is plausible that there are additional, yet undiscovered planets in the HD 23472 system. Ongoing research and advancements in detection methods may reveal more about this system in the future. For more information, see [[Potential for Additional Planets in the HD 23472 System]] and [[Formation Mechanisms of Super-Mercuries]].
