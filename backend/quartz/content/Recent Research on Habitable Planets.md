The largest habitable planet in the database has not been retrieved due to a technical issue with the database query. However, recent research indicates that scientists have discovered a planet that orbits two stars, reminiscent of Tatooine from "Star Wars." This planet, located about 120 light-years away in the constellation Leo, has shown signs of atmospheric water through observations from the Hubble, Spitzer, and Kepler space telescopes. Additionally, there is ongoing speculation about the habitability of one or two of the TRAPPIST-1 worlds, a system of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting a red dwarf star [[Largest Habitable Planets]] [[Understanding Habitable Planets | source text]] [[Recent Research on Habitable Planets | source text]] [[Smallest Known Exoplanet]].
