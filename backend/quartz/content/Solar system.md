For a planet to be considered habitable, it must meet certain criteria. See [[Criteria for Planet Habitability]] for more information. Additionally, see [[Temperature Range for Habitable Planets]] for details on the conditions necessary for habitability. There is also a possibility of more celestial bodies in our vicinity; refer to [[Potential for Additional Planets in the HD 23472 System | source text]] for further details.
