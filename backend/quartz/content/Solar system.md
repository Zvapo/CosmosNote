For a planet to be considered habitable, it must meet certain criteria. See [[Criteria for Planet Habitability]] for more information. Additionally, the size of a planet plays a crucial role in its habitability. For more details, refer to [[Largest Habitable Planet | the size of a planet]]. Recent research has also explored the potential for habitable conditions on other planets; see [[Recent Research on Habitable Planets]]. Understanding the factors that contribute to habitability is essential, as discussed in [[Understanding Habitable Planets | source text]]. Furthermore, the concept of the largest habitable planet is significant in this context; see [[Largest Habitable Planets]].
