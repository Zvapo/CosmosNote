## History

The solar system was formed 4.54 billion years ago. For more information on the formation of planets, see [[Formation Mechanisms of Super-Mercuries]]. Additionally, see [[11 Com b Overview]] for insights on other solar systems.

## Planets

The solar system has 8 planets:

- Mercury
- Venus
- [[Earth]]
- Mars
- Jupiter
- Saturn

For a planet to be considered habitable, it must meet certain criteria. See [[Criteria for Planet Habitability]] for more information. Additionally, there is a possibility of more celestial bodies in our vicinity; refer to [[Potential for Additional Planets in the HD 23472 System | source text]] for further details. For information on exoplanets, see [[14 Herculis b Exoplanet Overview | source text]], [[16 Cyg B b Exoplanet Overview]], and [[Smallest Known Exoplanet | source text]]. Understanding exoplanets is crucial for grasping the broader context of planetary systems; see [[Understanding Exoplanets | source text]], [[Exoplanets]], and [[Habitable Planets in the Universe]].
