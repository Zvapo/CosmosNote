**Habitable Planets: Definition and Characteristics**

Habitable planets are celestial bodies that have the potential to support life. The concept of habitability is primarily based on the following characteristics:

1. **Location in the Habitable Zone**: A habitable planet typically orbits within the "habitable zone" of its star, which is the region where conditions are just right for liquid water to exist on the planet's surface. This zone varies depending on the star's size and temperature.

2. **Presence of Liquid Water**: Water is essential for life as we know it. A planet must have the right conditions to maintain liquid water, which is crucial for biological processes.

3. **Atmospheric Conditions**: A suitable atmosphere is necessary to protect life from harmful radiation and to regulate temperature. The atmosphere should also contain essential gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide.

4. **Stable Climate**: A stable climate that allows for the development and sustenance of life forms is important. This includes a balance of temperature and weather patterns.

5. **Geological Activity**: Some geological activity can be beneficial for life, as it can recycle nutrients and create diverse environments.

6. **Chemical Composition**: The presence of essential elements and compounds, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, is vital for the formation of life.

As research continues, the criteria for what makes a planet habitable are being refined, especially with the discovery of extremophilesâ€”organisms that can survive in extreme conditions on Earth, suggesting that life may exist in a wider range of environments than previously thought.
